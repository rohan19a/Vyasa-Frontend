# Project Specification: Vyasa Web Application

## Overview
The Vyasa Web Application is a simple web-based user interface that allows users to interact with an API server for managing members. Users can perform actions like signing up, logging in, adding members, deleting members, and saving changes to the server. The application also includes a testing feature to analyze email text using the API.

## Features
1. Sign Up:
   - Users can sign up for the application by providing an email and password.
   - The application sends a POST request to the server with the user's credentials for registration.

2. Login:
   - Registered users can log in using their email and password.
   - The application sends a POST request to the server with the login credentials for verification.
   - Successful login hides the login and password fields.

3. Add Member:
   - Users, after logging in, can add a new member to the system.
   - Clicking the "Add Member" button creates a new member container with text fields for attributes like 'attributeId', 'emailId', 'name', 'role', 'description', 'authority', and 'department'.

4. Delete Member:
   - Users can delete the last added member.
   - Clicking the "Delete Member" button removes the last member container from the UI.

5. Save Changes:
   - Users can save the changes made to a member.
   - Clicking the "Save Changes" button sends a POST request to the server to update the member data.

6. Test Email Text:
   - Users can test email text using the application's testing feature.
   - Entering email content and the user's email ID, users can analyze the text using the API.
   - The analyzed email response is displayed in the "Output Email Text" textarea.

## Architecture
The application follows a client-server architecture with a simple front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and a back-end API server.

Front-end:
- HTML: Contains the user interface components.
- CSS: Provides styling for the application.
- JavaScript: Handles user interactions and communicates with the API server using fetch requests.

Back-end:
- API Server: Handles incoming requests and manages member data.
- API Endpoints:
  - `/signup`: Registers new users by accepting their email and password.
  - `/login`: Verifies user credentials for login.
  - `/get`: Retrieves member data from the server.
  - `/update`: Updates member data on the server.
  - `/demo`: Analyzes email text using the API.

## Development Setup
- Clone the repository: `<repository-url>`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start the development server: `npm start`
- Access the application on `http://localhost:3000`

## Deployment
The application can be deployed using a server hosting service or cloud platform. The front-end and back-end should be deployed separately, with appropriate configurations for the API server endpoints.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement user authentication and session management to handle multiple users securely.
- Add error handling and validation for user inputs.
- Provide visual feedback for successful actions and error messages.
- Implement pagination or lazy loading for the member list in case of a large number of members.
- Add features for updating individual member attributes.
- Improve the email text testing feature by adding more options and analysis capabilities.
- Integrate with a database for data persistence and real-time updates.

## Conclusion
The Vyasa Web Application provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the API server for managing members. By following the project specifications and future enhancements, the application can be further improved and expanded to cater to various user needs in the context of managing member data.
